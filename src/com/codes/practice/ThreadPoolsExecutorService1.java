// Java program to illustrate ThreadPool
// Executors
// Executors has all static methods including newFixedTreadPool() for creating a thread pool that use fixed
// number of threads operating off a shared unbounded queue.
//
//  the Executor interface does not strictly require that execution be asynchronous.
//  In the simplest case, an executor can run the submitted task immediately in the caller's thread:
//
// ExecutorService: an interface extends Executor
//  void execute(Runnable): inherited from interface java.util.concurrent.Executor and return void
//                          Once the task is assigned in the execute() method,
//                          we wonâ€™t get any response and forget about the task.
//  Future submit(Runnable): Submits a Runnable task for execution and returns a Future representing that task.
//                           Unlike the execute method, this method returns a future.
//                           In Java, the future represents the result of an asynchronous computation.
