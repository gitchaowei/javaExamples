//
// A stream in Java is a sequence of objects which operates on a data source such as an array or a collection and supports various methods.
// It was introduced in Java 8â€™s java.util.stream package.
// Stream supports many aggregate operations like filter, map, limit, reduce, find, and match to customize the original data into
// a different form according to the need of the programmer.
// The operations performed on a stream do not modify its source hence a new stream is created according to the operation applied to it.
// The new data is a transformed copy of the original form.
//
// Sequential Streams are non-parallel streams that use a single thread to process the pipelining.
// Any stream operation without explicitly specified as parallel is treated as a sequential stream.
// Sequential stream performs operation one by one.
//
// Parallel stream leverage multi-core processors, which increases its performance.
//
// The Java stream library provides a couple of ways to do it. easily, and in a reliable manner.
//
// 1) One of the simple ways to obtain a parallel stream is by invoking the parallelStream() method of Collection interface.
// 2) Another way is to invoke the parallel() method of BaseStream interface on a sequential stream.
